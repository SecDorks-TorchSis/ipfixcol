/**
 * \file countrycode.h
 * \brief File extends GeoIP C API functionality with additional table covering couples of ISO 3166 codes (NumCode and Alpha2Code)
 * \author Martin Rabek <xrabek1@mail.muni.cz>
 * \date 2012
 *
 * ISO 3166-1 Standard defines three basic sets of country codes: Alpha-2 code, Alpha-3 code and
 * Numeric code. Numeric (int) code is the best choice to store ctry code in our new extension,
 * however Maxmind C API, GeoIP, does not support it.
 *
 * That is the reason for this auxiliary file which defines own iso3166_GeoIP_country_codes[254] array,
 * where both NumCode and Alpha2Code exists in a defined country_code_iso3166_t structure. This array
 * is generated by a simple tool - numCodeTool (with newer versions of GeoIP C API it can be necessary
 * to generate it again). Superior advantage of using iso3166_GeoIP_country_codes[254] is that NumCode
 * is found out as fast as other GeoIP functions does.
 *
 * Next, there are declared two global variables for GeoIP database access because definition and using
 * for geolocation is not in one .c file so it must be a global variable.
