How to use Test Tool

./test.sh [/path/to/internalcfg.xml]

Tool runs test on each subfolder in ./tests except ipfix_data

Files in each folder:

startup.xml - configuration for running test, default template is in ./configs/default.xml
expected - expected test output
output - test output
params - file with ipfixcol parameters (optional), default is '-v -1 -c startup.xml'
preproc.sh - script that will be executed BEFORE test (optional)
postproc.sh - script that will be executed AFTER test and BEFORE comparing results (optional)

Folders named "ipfixsend *" use ipfixsend tool for testing IPFIXcol's input plugins.
These folder must contain "ipfixsend.sh" file which starts ipfixsend instance(s).

Test logs are stored in test.log file

Tool uses script create_internal.sh for making internalcfg.xml with paths to build folder.
