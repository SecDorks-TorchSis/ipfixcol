/**
 * \defgroup intermediateAPI Intermediate Plugins API

 *
 * These functions specify a communication interface between ipfixcol core and
 * intermediate plugins for data processing. Intermediate plugins get IPFIX
 * messages and are allowed to modify, create or drop the messages.
 * The intermediate plugins are connected in series by ring buffers, therefore
 * each message will pass all plugins one by one, unless some plugin discards
 * it.
